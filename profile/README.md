## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The bobbycar graz group has now officially dissolved and we do not want to maintain anything bobbycar related. We gave up on ordering motor controller PCBs and fixing all the many bugs in PCB design, we gave up on the boardcomputer firmware as collaboration was not possible, the firmware doesnt compile anymore, there are various forks running on different bobbycars, every bobbycar has other deadly bugs and crashes (for example when turning on bluetooth or running a too new esp idf version)

Since no work will ever be done on bobbycar graz projects we archived this now useless organization.

It will stay online as just to remember back the good old times :)
